# Rensa Core

Welcome to the documentation for **Rensa**, a powerful and flexible Nix flake framework.

Rensa is designed to help you organize your Nix projects into logical units called **Cells**,
making your code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Rensa, we recommend starting with the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) to build your first project.

## Core Concepts

Understand the philosophy behind Rensa by reading about [Concepts](concepts.md), including:

- **Cells**: Functional domains of your project.
- **Blocks**: Typed outputs within cells.
- **Actions**: CLI commands for your cells.

## API Reference

For detailed information on Rensa's functions and helpers, check the [API Reference](api.md).

## Ecosystem

See [Related Libraries](libraries.md) to see how to extend Rensa with pre-built solutions for development shells, documentation, CI, and more.

## Further Reading

Rensa is inspired by `std`. For more in-depth information on the underlying concepts, you can refer to the [std Reference](https://std.divnix.com/reference/std.html).
